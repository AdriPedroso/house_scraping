# house_scraping
This program helps you to find a house, scraping the web pisos.com and sending you an email with the information

You need to install the libraries:

- bs4
- requests
- lxml

On the main.py you have to change the #url variable with your search.

The idea is to put this script on a server, so that it runs every hour (or whatever time you prefer)

This script is UNDER DEVELOPMENT
